# Oracle Jet Component Creator
---

```ojet-comp``` is a library developed for Oracle Jet to easily generate custom components and setup peer dependencies inside your Oracle Jet project.

## Installation
To start using ```ojet-comp``` simply download and install it using npm (make sure the ```-g``` flag is set so that you can use it across multiple projects):
```npm install ojet-comp -g```

Oracle JET requires you to specify the custom components module inside your ```main.js``` file, to do so, add the dependency like so:
```
requirejs.config(
    {
      baseUrl: 'js',
      ...
      {
        ...
        'customElements': 'libs/webcomponents/CustomElements',
        ...
      }
      ...
    }
);
```

## Usage
To use this package, you must be in the root of the project (the top level of the project folder. Simply execute the module by typing ```ojet-comp```, the module will run you through a CLI creation wizard to create your component. Once the wizard is complete, your module will be ready to use.
**Note**: Your custom module must still be required inside the define block of whatever view model you intend to use it in.
